1. The book states, “Interactions with an MVC application follow a natural cycle
of user actions and view updates, where the view is assumed to be stateless.”
What does it mean for the view to be stateless?



2. The book identiﬁes two kinds of models. Brieﬂy describe each of them.

`` View Models simply transfers data from the controllers to the views.
Domain Models contain the data in a business domain, along with the operations,
transformations, and rules for creating, storing, and manipulating that data. ``

3. Give an example of separation of concerns from your own life experience.
This should be a simple, everyday example.

``dirty laundry and clean laundry``

4. What is a view engine?

``The view engine processes user request and returns required view. ``

5. The book notes that the three-tier structure, or n-tier model, is “the most
widely used pattern for business applications.” Why do you think that this is
true? An answer like, “Because it works well,” is not a suﬃcient answer to this
question.

``I think it breaks large complex systems into smaller pieces which makes them
easier to manage``

6. This question requires some outside research. When we study UWP, you will see
that the UWP design pattern is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). What is the
diﬀerence between MVC and MVVM that makes the ﬁrst good for ASP.NET MVC and the
second good for UWP?

7. Describe the two parts of the dependency injection (DI) design pattern.



8. Give an example of loose coupling from your own life experience. This should
be a simple, everyday example.



9. What are the two types of testing discussed in the book?



10. What are the seven steps of the test driven development (TDD) workﬂow, as
stated in the book?
