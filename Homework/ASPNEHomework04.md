1. Using automatic properties is a shortcut that avoids several explicit steps.
List the steps that the use of automatic properties avoids.

change get/set statements without changing the classes, create the pattern of a
field-backed property without defining the field or specifying the get/set

2. Using the object initializer syntax is a shortcut that avoids several
explicit steps. List the steps that the use of object initializers avoids.

allows creation and population in a single step

3. What is the purpose of creating extension methods?

adding methods that you cant modify directly

4. What is the one feature of extension methods that will always allow you to
identify a method as an extension method?

the this keyword

5. How do you create an extension method that ﬁlters the results returned by the method on a user speciﬁed criterion?

The yield keyword.

6. Explain the syntax of a lambda expression. The term “lambda expression” originates in the lambda calculus developed by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930’s. There is a class of programming languages that are based on the fundamental ideas of lambda calculus.
The => characters are read aloud as “goes to” and links the parameter to the result of the lambda expression.

7. This will require some outside research. What is the distinction between an
anonymously typed variable and a dynamically typed variable?

A dynamically typed variable isn't assigned a type until run-time. An
anonymously typed variable is given type var so that an explicit specification
is not required.

8. You are having a discussion about C# with a friend of yours that uses another language. You are telling him about C#’s LINQ library. How would you describe to him the diﬀerence between LINQ’s SQL-like notation and LINQ’s dot notation?
Dot notation is a way to utilize extension methods because of the lack of corresponding keywords.

9. What, exactly, does the await keyword do?

Applying the await keyword means I can treat the result from a method as though
it were a regular method and just assign the return to a variable.

10. What is the connection between await and the async keywords?

In order to use the await keyword, you must use the async keyword to the method
signature.
